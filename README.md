# REACT DEMO WITH TYPESCRIPT
this is a repo to start learning react with typescript and webpack

## How to run the application
1. Clone the repository
2. npm install
3. npm run build 
4. run 'live-server' and you will see your app

## Step 2
We'll here by setting up a scoreboard view and then we'll build the base components to refactor the app. We are going add some features to dynamize the application.

To follow along, run *git checkout step2-1*

To see the final result *git checkout step2-2*


### What we've added
In this step, we came with a base template (Thanks to [Jim Hoskins](https://teamtreehouse.com/jim)) to works with. Jim created a react tutorial on [teamtreehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-basics) but uses ES5. 
We'll be using the base template as him and with our typescript skills, we'll make another approach to design the scoreboard application.
